- View your performance trends

## Claiming Your Invite

Your coach will provide you with an invite code. Here's how to set up your account:

### Step 1: Access the Invite Link

Your coach will share a link or code with you. It might look like:
- `https://your-app-url/join/ABC123XYZ456`
- Or just the code: `ABC123XYZ456`

### Step 2: Create Your Account

1. Navigate to the application URL or click the invite link
2. You'll see a page showing:

   - **Confirm Password**: Re-enter your password
   - **Phone Number** (optional): For notifications
4. Click "Create Account"

### Step 3: Success!

After account creation:
- You're automatically logged in
- You're added to your coach's team roster
- You can immediately access assigned clips

### Invite Code Issues?

**Code doesn't work:**
- Check that you typed it correctly (it's case-sensitive)

4. **Note questions** to ask your coach

## Marking Clips as Reviewed

- Discuss during one-on-one meetings

### Can I watch clips more than once?

Absolutely! Watch as many times as needed to understand the coaching points.
