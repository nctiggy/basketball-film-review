## Getting Started

As a parent, you can access the same film and statistics that your child sees. This allows you to:

- View all clips assigned to your child
- Watch the same coaching feedback they receive
- Track their game statistics and performance
- Stay informed about their development
- Support their basketball journey

**Important**: Parents have view-only access. You cannot modify anything or see other players' content.

## Claiming Your Parent Invite

The coach will provide a parent-specific invite code that links you to your child's account.

### Step 1: Get Your Invite Code

Your child's coach will provide:
- A parent invite link or code
- This is different from a player invite
- It's specifically linked to your child

### Step 2: Create Your Parent Account

1. Navigate to the application URL or click the invite link
2. You'll see confirmation that this is a parent invite for your child
3. Fill in your account information:
   - **Username**: Choose a unique username
   - **Display Name**: Your full name
   - **Password**: Create a strong password
   - **Confirm Password**: Re-enter your password
   - **Phone Number** (optional)
4. Click "Create Account"

### Step 3: Account Created

After creating your account:
- You're automatically linked to your child
- You can immediately view their clips and stats
- You have the same view they have

### Multiple Children

If you have multiple children on the team:
- The coach can generate separate parent invites for each child
- Each invite links you to that specific child
- You'll see all linked children in your dashboard
- You can switch between children to view their content

## Signing In

To access the application:

1. Go to the application URL
2. Select "Parent Sign In" (or use the player/parent login)
3. Enter your **username** and **password**
4. Click "Sign In"

Your parent dashboard loads automatically.

## Your Parent Dashboard

After signing in, you'll see:

### Children List

If you have multiple children linked:
- All children appear in a list
- Click on a child to view their content
- Switch between children anytime

### Selected Child's Content

For the selected child, you see:
- **Assigned Clips**: All clips their coach has assigned
- **Statistics**: Their game stats and season averages
- **Team Information**: Team name, coach, season

This is exactly what your child sees in their account.

## Viewing Your Child's Clips

### Finding Clips

Clips are listed in the same order your child sees them:
- High priority clips first
- Unviewed clips before viewed clips
- Newest first

Each clip shows:
- Game name and date
- Timestamp in the game
- Tags (play types, skills)
- Coach's message
- Priority level
- Whether your child has viewed it

### Watching Clips

1. Click on any clip to open it
2. The clip plays with:
   - Video footage
   - Coach's annotations (drawings on the video)
   - Voice-over feedback (if added)
   - Written notes

### Understanding What You're Watching

**Annotations**
- Arrows show movement or direction
- Circles highlight players or areas
- Lines show spacing or cutting lanes
- Text adds labels or key points

**Voice-Over**
- Your child's coach providing personal feedback
- Explains what to watch for
- Gives specific coaching points

**Priority Levels**
- **High**: Important clips to review soon
- **Normal**: Regular film study
- **Low**: Optional or extra viewing

### Viewing Status

You can see:
- **Not Viewed**: Your child hasn't opened it yet
- **Viewed**: They've watched it (shows timestamp)
- **Acknowledged**: They've marked it as reviewed

This helps you:
- Know if they're keeping up with assignments
- Remind them about unwatched clips
- Discuss specific clips with them

## Viewing Your Child's Statistics

### Season Overview

The dashboard shows your child's season averages:
- **Games Played**: Total games with stats
- **Points Per Game**: Average scoring
- **Rebounds Per Game**: Average rebounds
- **Assists Per Game**: Average assists
- **Field Goal %**: Overall shooting percentage
- **3-Point %**: Three-point shooting
- **Free Throw %**: Free throw shooting

Click "View All Stats" to see each game:
- Game name and date

### Understanding the Numbers

**Trends**
- Are they improving over time?

- What could use more work?

**Context Matters**

## Supporting Your Child

### Ways to Help

**Watch Clips Together**
- Ask if they want to watch clips with you
- Let them explain what the coach is teaching
- Don't criticize; this is learning time
- Ask questions: "What did you notice?"

**Encourage Film Study**
- Check if they've watched new clips
- Make it part of their routine
- Praise engagement with feedback
- Don't nag; encourage instead

**Discuss Stats Appropriately**
- Celebrate improvements
- Don't focus only on points
- Acknowledge effort stats (rebounds, assists)
- Keep it positive and growth-focused

**Talk About Clips**
- "Did coach send any new clips?"
- "What are you working on this week?"
- "Want to tell me about that play?"
- Let them lead the conversation

### What NOT to Do

**Don't Over-Coach**
- The coach provides feedback through clips
- Adding your own coaching can confuse
- Support the coach's instruction
- Let the coach be the coach

**Don't Pressure**
- Stats aren't everything
- Development takes time
- Enjoy the process
- Focus on effort and attitude

**Don't Compare**

- Respect privacy
- Focus on individual growth

**Don't Share Content**
- Clips are for your family only
- Don't share clips on social media
- Don't share with other parents
- Respect team privacy

### Having Good Conversations

**After Watching Clips:**
- "What did coach want you to see there?"
- "What are you working on in practice?"
- "How do you feel about that?"

**About Statistics:**
- "You had a great game!"
- "I saw your rebounds are improving"
- "You played hard out there"

**Encouraging Growth:**
- "What goal are you working toward?"
- "How can I support you?"
- "I'm proud of your effort"
